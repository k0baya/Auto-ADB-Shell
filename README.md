## Auto_ADB_Shell

Autostart `ADB` commands for certain applications via magisk (e.g. brevent, scene, shizuku, etc.)

Already tested on OnePlus13 (Color OS 15).

### Modification Methods

Just follow the part of the `service.sh` file that executes the `ADB` command by heart. After modifying it, package it into a new `.zip` file and flash it in magisk.
